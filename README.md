# Welcome Back

Are you sick of JavaScript? Elegebility? Do you yearn for the days of 
webrings and shit, back when GIFs were the height of technology? I sure do.

Well welcome to the only social media that rejects 'UX' design, that
idolises the originality of the craftsmanship of normal people who did
what they could with the tools available. Welcome to y2kMe.

## Join me. Express yourself.

If you want a page up on y2kMe, tweet me at @OoohThatsGood or put up
an issue or something and I'll put it up. In the future I'll get some
kind of UI to make pages that can appear here.

## What can I do here?

Every page is made with stuff that is LOW TECH. Even lower tech than what
was available in the actual year 2000. We're talking:

 - No Javascript.
 - No `input` because, you know, security concerns.

We're talking baby html4. If you want other stuff make your own website.

# I love you

I hope you all have fun on my page.

# About me

My name's william, I am a full stack developer who is sick of the 
internet being used for profit and surveilance, where the people's 
value is judged on ad impressions and not their creative output. 

Even mastodon is bullshit, it's just twitter for dorks who don't like
Peepeelong Brusk.

*That got pretty tinfoil hatty.*

What I'm trying to say is that sometimes you need to escape and just 
throw some classic internet shit up! Times new roman! Padding? Never
heard of her! Here's my cat! 

Don't do it for the likes, do it because you have a voice inside you
that can only be expressed in HOT PINK and hyperlinks!

# Content Policy.

Privacy Policy stuff, I don't care who you are. I'm not going to run
ads off this site. Any personal details you put on the site is your own
problem.

We're running on a "I know it when I see it" policy when it comes to 
hate-speech, and other bullshit. I reserve the right to kick you off for
being a wiener.

Spread love!
